# 📚 Easy-NotebookLM
English | [中文](./README_zn.md)

**Easy-NotebookLM** is a tool designed to generate Chinese podcasts based on the concept of Google's NotebookLM. It transforms content from PDF documents into natural, conversational-style podcast audio and supports multiple dialogue styles. Currently, it uses the [DeepSeek-v3](https://platform.deepseek.com/) API for model inference, though you can replace it with any other compatible model interface. For speech synthesis, it leverages the **CosyVoice** model.

> 🎙️ NotebookLM is an AI audio content generation tool developed by Google, previously limited to English content only. Easy-NotebookLM aims to provide a simple and user-friendly way to quickly generate high-quality Chinese podcasts from PDF files.
